## Description
This is the repo for kaggle competition "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets".

Offical Description by kaggle:
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
